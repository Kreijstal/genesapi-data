All persons are covered whose place of residence\nand place of work are in the relevant geographic area, and\nadditionally all non-residents (commuters) working in this\narea. Employment covers all persons engaged in productive\nactivity that falls within the production boundary of the\nnational accounts.\nPersons in employment are employees or self-employed\npersons. Persons holding more than one job are classified as\nemployees or self-employed according to their main job.\n(European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA\n2010), Chapter 11) In accordance with the definition of the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), too, any person at\nworking age is considered to be in employment if he or she\nworked for pay, as self-employed or as a family worker for\nat least one hour in the one-week reference period. Hence,\nit is irrelevant whether the employment is the person\u0092s main\nsource of livelihood. Persons in formal employment who were\ntemporarily not able to perform their job in the reference\nperiod are regarded as being in employment.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Persons in employment (domestic concept)", "type": "variable"}
