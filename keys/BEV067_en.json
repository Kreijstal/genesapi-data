{"code": "BEV067", "lang": "en", "description": "\nNet reproduction rate\n\nExplanatory notes for the following statistics:\n12612 Birth statistics\n\nDefinition:\nThe net reproduction rate is defined as the average number\nof live daughters a woman would have if the age-specific\nfertility rates of the reference year and a specific life\ntable applied during her entire lifetime. The rate indicates\nthe extent to which a generation of women is replaced by the\ngeneration of their daughters, considering not only\nfertility but also mortality. The calculation of the net\nreproduction rate accounts for the fact that not every girl\nis going to have children of her own as she may, for\ninstance, die before her reproductive phase due to infant or\nchild mortality. If the net reproduction rate is higher than\n1, then, on average, more than one daughter is born per\nwoman and the population grows. If the rate is 1, the\ngeneration of daughters corresponds to the generation of\nmothers and the size of the population remains constant. If\nthe net reproduction rate is smaller than 1, the generation\nof mothers is not replaced by the generation of daughters\nand the population shrinks. These population development\nrules apply in the long term. The current population change\nis influenced also by the age structure of the population\nand migration.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Net reproduction rate", "type": "variable"}
