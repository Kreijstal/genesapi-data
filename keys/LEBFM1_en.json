A living arrangement\nmay comprise one or several persons. Generally, the private\nliving arrangements of the population are recorded\nstatistically along two \"axes\" in the microcensus. The first\nis parenthood and the second partnership. In accordance with\nthis pattern, the living arrangements of the population\ninclude couples with never-married children and without\nnever-married children, lone parents with children, and\nunattached persons without a partner and without\nnever-married children in their household. As it is a\nhousehold survey, the microcensus focuses on the network of\nrelations among the people surveyed within their own home,\nthat is, on their joint household. Therefore,\nparent-child-relations across household boundaries and\npartnerships where the partners live apart together are\ndisregarded. Living arrangements at the second residence and\nthe population in collective living quarters are not taken\ninto account.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Living arrangements", "type": "variable"}
