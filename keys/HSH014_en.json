The\ntrends variant extrapolates the changes so far observed in\nthe distribution of the population by household size. The\nstatus quo variant keeps the initial conditions constant.\nBoth variants reflect the effects of the future population\ndevelopment on the number of households. However, changes in\nthe population's behaviour regarding household formation and\ntheir impact on the structure of households are only\nreflected in the trends variant. It therefore constitutes a\nmore comprehensive model for the future.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Projected households", "type": "variable"}
