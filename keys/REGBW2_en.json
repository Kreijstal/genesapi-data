For the representation by citizenship at the regional\nlevel, the following change items are relevant:\nAdditions to the register (total additions) comprise the\nfirst entries and re-entries to Germany and the births of\nforeigners in Germany.\nExits from the register comprise departures and ex-officio\nderegistrations and deaths of foreigners in Germany.\nArrivals and departures (here including ex-officio\nderegistrations) are often referred to as net immigration\nfrom abroad. Arrivals within Germany are calculated\nseparately at the relevant level: At the Land level, only\narrivals from other L\u00e4nder are included, whereas at the\nlevel of administrative districts the arrivals from other\nadministrative districts of the same Land are also included.\nadministrative districts of the same Land are also included.\nConsequently, the total of arrivals at the level of\nadministrative districts within an administrative region or\nwithin a Land is larger than the number of arrivals shown\nfor the relevant administrative region or Land.\nArrival and departure in the same year means that the\nrelevant persons stayed for less than 12 months in the\nreference year. They are contained neither in the opening\nstock nor in the closing stock of the year.\nAlso, the register stock is reduced by the deletion of\nentries, typically by naturalisations (exit through deletion\nfrom the Central Register of Foreigners).\nThe number of foreigners in a breakdown by citizenship is\nalso reduced by changes in citizenship. The value of a\ncitizenship increases when a foreigner acquires this\ncitizenship in the reference year and it decreases when a\nforeigner loses the citizenship. The column \"balance of\ncases of citizenship acquired/lost\" shows the balance of\nthese values. A positive balance means that the number of\nforeigners acquiring this citizenship was larger than of\nthose losing it; a negative value means the opposite. Kosovo\nis a typical example of a positive value and Serbia of a\nnegative value because, since 2008, many Kosovars exchanged\ntheir former Serbian passport for a Kosovar passport.\nIn addition, changes in the number of foreigners in a\nbreakdown by administrative district occur through changes\nof administrative district caused by a reform of districts.\nHere, the cases are cancelled from the dissolved\nadministrative district and entered in the new district.\nGenerally, the foreigners stay registered with the same\nforeigners authority. The new district thus has a positive\nbalance, the dissolved district a negative one.\nThe change items may include cases that did not occur in the\nreference year, for example, when an arrival or a departure\nwhich occurred in the preceding year was not covered in the\nstock of that year and was covered in the reference year\ninstead.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "Changes in the register (regional level)", "type": "variable"}
