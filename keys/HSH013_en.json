They are also\ncalled household members. The population in collective\nliving quarters is excluded, while households within\ncollective living quarters are included.\nThe population in households is the difference between the\npopulation entitled to accommodation and the population in\ncollective living quarters. As a person may be entitled to\naccommodation in several households, he or she may be\ncounted twice. The absent household reference person, for\nexample, who lives in another municipality and has a second\nresidence as a subtenant there, is part of two households.\nFirst, such persons belong to the household of their family\nand second, as subtenants, they form one-person households.\nThis is justified by the fact that households use\nresidential space and the facilities of the respective\nmunicipality at each place of residence.\nThe results for household members and the population in\nprivate households differed until 1990 because different\nextrapolation methods were used for these two value\nvariables.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Household members", "type": "variable"}
