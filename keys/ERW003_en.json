From this aspect, the concept of\nunemployed persons is more comprehensive than that of\nregistered unemployed. In line with the employment status\nconcept, however, registered unemployed who are temporarily\nin marginal employment are not counted as unemployed persons\nbut as persons in employment.\n\n\n13231 Unemployment statistics based on the ILO concept\n================================================\n\nDefinition:\nAccording to the labour force concept established by the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) and concretised by\nthe EU, any person not economically active and aged between\n15 and 74 years is considered unemployed if he or she\nactively sought work over the four weeks preceding the\nsurvey and would be available for starting a job\nimmediately, that is, within two weeks. It is irrelevant\nwhether the person is registered as unemployed with an\nemployment agency.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Unemployed persons", "type": "variable"}
