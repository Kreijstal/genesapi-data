A distinction is made between\naccommodation establishments providing bed places (e.g.\nhotels and guest houses) and tourist camp-sites offering\ncamping pitches for overnight stays. Accommodation\nestablishments also include accommodation facilities that\nare run on a part-time basis.\n\nThere is a break in the time series from reference month\nJanuary 2012. This is due to an amendment of the\nAccommodation Statistics Act which now provides for a new\nsurvey cut-off threshold in line with the relevant new EU\nregulation relating to tourism statistics. The number of bed\nplaces has been raised from nine to ten for accommodation\nestablishments and that of camping pitches from three to ten\nfor tourist camp-sites.\nTo facilitate year-on-year comparisons, the monthly results\nfor 2011 were recalculated as required.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "Open accommodation establishments", "type": "variable"}
