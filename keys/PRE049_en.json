The individual relatives are obtained from\nindividual price series (of individual reporting units) on\nthe basis of the (monthly, unweighted) prices in the base\nyear (= 100).\n\nThen, for every good, the individual relatives available for\nit are taken to form an average relative as a simple\narithmetic mean. The average relatives are weighted\naccording to the individual price representatives'\nimportance in terms of turnover or expenditure in the base\nyear and are aggregated to form the indices for classes,\nsubgroups, groups and other meaningful groupings, and the\noverall index.\n\nThe individual price series are based on the results of the\nmonthly collection of prices performed with a representative\nsample of reporting units (Land forest administrations). The\nvalues of an individual price series should reflect only\npure price changes. To achieve this, all factors relevant\nfor the price level - the price-determining variables - have\nto be kept constant for as long as possible. This applies\nnot only to the quantity unit of the price representatives\nmonitored and their overall quality, but also to the various\nterms of trade, delivery and payment. If one of these\nvariables changes, the difference between the new price and\nthe one last reported may contain a non-genuine price\nchange, which has to be eliminated.\n\nThe index is calculated through the Laspeyres formula. This\nmeans that the weights from the current base year will\nremain unchanged until the index is put on a new base year.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "Producer price indices for logging products", "type": "variable"}
