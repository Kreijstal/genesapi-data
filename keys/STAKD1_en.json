Until 30 June\n1993 this applied only to children born inside marriage;\nchildren born outside marriage were Germans only if the\nmother was a German. Since 1 July 1993 a child born outside\nmarriage to a foreign mother and a German father also\nacquires German citizenship by birth. The acquisition of\nGerman citizenship may be claimed as soon as paternity has\neffectively been established in accordance with German law.\nPart of the children shown in the table who have foreign\ncitizenship and parents not married to each other will\ntherefore hold German citizenship later, after a German has\nacknowledged paternity or a court has established a German's\npaternity. Since 2000, children are shown as German citizens\nif their German father's acknowledgement of paternity was\nregistered when they were born.\nOn 1 January 2000, a new citizenship law became effective.\nIn accordance with that law, not only children whose father\nor mother are Germans acquire German citizenship by birth\nbut also children of foreign parents if one parent has been\nlegally and ordinarily resident in Germany for eight years\nand holds an unlimited residence permit or either holds a\nresidence permit as a citizen of Switzerland.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Citizenship of child and parents", "type": "variable"}
