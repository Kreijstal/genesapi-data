This may refer to goods produced in the\ndomestic territory or to imported goods. Not covered are\ncases where producers sell goods directly to retailers or\nfinal consumers. The reference variable of the overall index\nis the total of all turnovers realised in wholesale trade in\nthe base year, less retail sales, export values and other\nsales not belonging to wholesale trade. In this way,\nturnover realised between wholesale businesses is also\ncovered by price statistics (no-netting principle of price\nindex calculation for any economic sector). As regards the\nmajor steps of calculation, the index can be referred to as\nthe weighted mean of the price relatives (average\nrelatives), which are determined for a representative\nselection of goods for resale (price representatives). The\nturnover shares of the selected products in the base year\nare used as weights.\n\nThe individual price series are shown as index numbers based\non the prices in the base year (= 100). They are based on\nthe results of the monthly collection of prices performed\nwith a representative sample of wholesale businesses. The\nreference date of the surveys is the fifth day of the\nreference month. The prices contractually agreed upon on\nthat day (possibly shortly before or after) are collected.\n\nThe monthly values of an individual price series should\nreflect only pure price changes. To achieve this, all\nfactors relevant for the price level - the price-determining\nvariables - have to be kept constant for as long as\npossible. This applies not only to the overall quality of\nthe goods monitored, their unit of quantity and quantity\nsold, but also to the various terms of trade, delivery and\npayment. If one of these variables changes, suitable quality\nadjustment methods will be applied.\n\nThe prices collected monthly are actual prices (no list or\nbasic prices or average receipts), excluding turnover tax,\nbut including any excise duties (e.g. mineral oil tax,\ntobacco tax) and other legal duties (e.g. oil storage\ncontribution for mineral oil products). Currently, selling\nprices are collected from roughly 1,200 reporting units in\n66 economic branches. The index is based on a total of about\n3,600 individual price series. For the product categories of\nfruit and vegetables, potatoes and animal feed, meat and\nlivestock, and sea fish, price quotations at important\ncentral markets and commodity exchanges are used, too.\n\nThe index is calculated through the Laspeyres formula. This\nmeans that the weights from the current base year will\nremain unchanged until the index will be put on a new base\nyear.\n\nThe index of wholesale prices is calculated and released not\nonly as an overall series but also in a breakdown according\nto the Classification of Economic Activities (Klassifikation\nder Wirtschaftszweige - WZ).\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016\nIndex of wholesale prices\n\nExplanatory notes for the following statistics:\n61281 Index of selling prices in wholesale trade\n\nDefinition:\nThe index of wholesale prices measures the movement of the\nprices of goods sold by wholesalers in Germany to the extent\nthat these sales are included under wholesale, such as\ncontracts concluded with resellers, processors or other\nlarge customers.
