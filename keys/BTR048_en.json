The basic tax rate for\nhome traders and people of equal status is 1.96 percent. If\na business maintains establishments in various\nmunicipalities, an establishment extends across several\nmunicipalities, or an establishment relocates to another\nmunicipality during the period for which tax is collected,\nthe base tax amount is divided among the municipalities that\nhave the right to impose the tax. The municipality with the\nright to impose the tax stipulates the trade tax assessment\nrate. The annual tax due from the business is established by\napplying this assessment rate to the base tax amount (or to\nthe municipality's allocated share) (Section 16 of the Trade\nTax Act).\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "Positive base tax amount/allocated share", "type": "variable"}
