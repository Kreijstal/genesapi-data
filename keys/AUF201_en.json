To\ncalculate the index excluding major orders, major orders are\nsubtracted from the values of new orders in the reference\nmonth. This total of values is related to the relevant\nmonthly average excluding major orders in the base year and\nforms the value index for an economic branch.\nThese indices are aggregated to form indices for\n\"manufacturing\" and for its main industrial groupings. This\nis done by means of the proportions of the values of new\norders excluding major orders in the base year.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "New orders excluding major orders: Value index", "type": "variable"}
