People are\nat risk of disability if impairment can be expected. The\nstatistics of severely disabled people indicate the most\nsevere disability if people have several disabilities.\n\nThe impact on participation in society is identified in\nterms of the degree of disablement (GdB) expressed in\nincrements of ten (20 to 100).\nPeople are recognised as severely disabled if a\n\"Versorgungsamt\" (pension office) has determined a degree of\ndisablement of 50 or more. Upon request, the pension offices\nprovide these people with a severely disabled person's pass.\nThe criteria used to determine the degree of disablement are\nthe \"Versorgungsmedizinische Grunds\u00e4tze\" (Pension and\nmedical care principles) in the relevant up-to-date wording\n(cf. \"Versorgungsmedizin-Verordnung\" (Pension and medical\ncare ordinance - VersMedV)). The VersMedV, which replaced\nthe previous \"Anhaltspunkte\" (Guidelines), entered into\nforce on 1 January 2009.\n\nThe causes of disability include for instance congenital\ndisorders, diseases, accidents, and war, military service or\ncivilian service-related injuries.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Severely disabled people", "type": "variable"}
