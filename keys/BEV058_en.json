The\npopulation in families / living arrangements at their main\nresidence does not include the population in collective\nliving quarters (for example, old peoples' homes). The\npopulation in families / living arrangements at their main\nresidence includes all members of a family / living\narrangement (for example, cohabiting couple with children)\nwhose reference person lives at the main residence,\nirrespective of where they stay at the reference date. This\nmeans that individual members of the family / living\narrangement may live at a second residence while, at the\nsame time, they are counted as part of the population in\nfamilies / living arrangements at their main residence, as\nthis is the residence of the reference person of their\nfamily / living arrangement. At the same time, the living\narrangement examined can be represented as a closed unit\nbelonging together, even if individual members are\ntemporarily absent.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Population in families / living arrangements", "type": "variable"}
