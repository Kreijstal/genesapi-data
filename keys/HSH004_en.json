Included are all persons\nwho run a household alone (one-person household) or together\nwith other people (multi-person household) at their main or\nsecond residence. They are also called household members.\nThe population in collective living quarters (e.g.\ninhabitants of old peoples' homes) is excluded, while\nhouseholds within collective living quarters are included\n(e.g. household of the director). As a rule, the population\nin households is not broken down by main and second\nresidence. As a person may be entitled to accommodation in\nseveral households, he or she may be counted multiple times.\nThe absent household reference person, for example, who\nlives in another municipality and has a second residence as\na subtenant there, is part of two households. First, such\npersons belong to the household of their family and second,\nas subtenants, they are regarded as separate households.\nWith a view to issues of infrastructural planning, this is\njustified by the fact that households use residential space\nand the facilities of the respective municipality at each\nplace of residence.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Population in private households", "type": "variable"}
