These establishments, which provide\nmonthly data, cover over 80% of the value of German\nindustrial production. The production data reported are used\nto calculate production relatives (related to the monthly\naverage of the reference year), with value data being\nadjusted for price variations, using indices of producer\nprices of industrial products. Using gross production value\nproportions from the base year, these relatives are then\naggregated to obtain indices for economic branches as\ndefined in the Classification of Economic Activities, 2008\nedition (WZ 2008). The indices for the four-digit economic\nbranches are combined to achieve indices for higher-level\naggregates of the WZ 2008 (three-digit items, two-digit\nitems, main industrial groupings) and the overall production\nindex. This is done by using for each economic branch its\nshare of gross value added at factor cost in the total value\nof industry in the base year. These value-added figures come\nfrom the annual structural surveys in industry. Based on the\nsame method, the Federal Statistical Office also calculates\na quarterly production index by aggregating the three\nmonthly reports received from the establishments in\nmanufacturing with 50 or more persons employed and the\nproduction data from the other establishments obliged to\nreport quarterly data and belonging to enterprises with\ngenerally 20 or more persons employed in industry. To\nimprove the quality of the monthly production indices, they\nare adjusted to the level of the relevant quarterly\nproduction index for every economic branch.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "Index of production", "type": "variable"}
