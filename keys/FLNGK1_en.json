The definition of the\nagriculturally used area does not exactly match that of the\nutilised agricultural area (UAA) as used in agricultural\nstatistics. Accordingly, areas that are specially evaluated\nto determine the assessed value (for example, horticultural\nand viticultural areas) are part of the UAA but not of the\nagriculturally used area.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "Size class of sold agricult. used area per sale", "type": "variable"}
