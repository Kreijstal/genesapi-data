They are included in the statistics of births. If\nthe foetus weighs less than 500 grams, it is a miscarriage.\nMiscarriages are not shown in the civil status records.\nUntil 31 March 1994, a minimum birth weight of 1,000 grams\nwas used to distinguish between stillbirth and miscarriage.\nUntil 30 June 1979, children with a minimum body length of\n35 cm were regarded as stillborn. Consequently, children not\nborn alive whose body length was under 35 cm were regarded\nas miscarriages at that time.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Stillborn children", "type": "variable"}
