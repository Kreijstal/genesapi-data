Also included are separately invoiced\nfreight, postage and packaging costs, own consumption and\nthe private use of company property with the relevant\naccounting value.\nPrice reductions and the value of goods returned must be\ndeducted from the invoiced values.\nTurnover does not comprise extraordinary and non-operating\nrevenue like, for instance, proceeds from the sale of fixed\nassets and interest received.\n\n\n44131 Quarterly survey of building completion work\n============================================\n44152 Short-term statistics of building completion work\n=================================================\n\nDefinition:\nThe quarterly survey of building completion work includes\nlocal units with 20 or more persons employed. Using the so-\ncalled \"mixed model\" in the short-term statistics of\nbuilding completion work, the turnover data of the primary\nsurvey are supplemented with administrative data (turnover\ndata of the fiscal authorities) for local units with less\nthan 20 persons employed. The result of applying this mixed\nmodel can practically be equated with a complete\nenumeration.\n\n- Definition \"Quarterly survey of building completion\nwork\":\nTurnover, irrespective of the receipt of payment, is the\ntotal amount of invoiced supplies and services provided to\nthird parties (excluding turnover tax), including tax-exempt\nturnover, trade turnover and proceeds from supplies and\nservices provided to sales organisations in which the\ncompany has a stake.

The fiscal\nauthorities provide the Federal Statistical Office and the\nstatistical offices of the L\u00e4nder with information on\nenterprises with taxable turnover from supplies and services\ntogether with data for turnover tax statistics. The data\nmaterial provided by the fiscal authorities covers all\nenterprises liable to pay turnover tax which, in the\nreference year, submitted advance turnover tax returns in\nGermany. The turnover of some enterprises is not contained\nin the data of the fiscal authorities. Turnover data not\ncontained are those of small enterprises (enterprises with a\nturnover of up to 17,500 euros in the previous year and an\nexpected turnover of not more than 50,000 euros in the\nreference year) and of enterprises which realise almost only\ntax exempt turnover or for which no tax payable arises. The\nlatter applies only where enterprises do not renounce the\noption of tax exemption. Other turnover data not included\nare those of annual respondents, that is, of taxpayers who\nhad to pay less than 1,000 euros of turnover tax in the\nprevious year and who, upon request, were exempted from the\nobligation to submit advance turnover tax returns.\nIn addition to craft turnover, the taxable turnover of the\nvarious craft enterprises also comprises turnover from\nnon-craft activities. For example, car dealers generally\noperate a repair shop and, consequently, are registered in\nthe official crafts register. Those enterprises also achieve\nturnover from the sale of new and used cars. It is not\npossible to divide the taxable turnover into craft turnover\nand other turnover using subject-related criteria. This\nmeans that non-craft turnover is included in the turnover of\nthe craft enterprises as shown.\nAs, in accordance with the Crafts Statistics Act, only\ncrafts entrepreneurs are included in the census of crafts,\nturnover from craft activities achieved in subsidiary\nestablishments or internal departments of non-craft\nenterprises is not included in the turnover shown.\n\n\n53211 Quarterly report on crafts\n==========================\n\nDefinition:\nIn this set of statistics, turnover data comprise taxable\nsupplies and services, less tax-exempt supplies and services\nwithout input tax deduction, of craft enterprises. The data\ncome from the advance turnover tax returns. They are\nreported by the fiscal authorities of the L\u00e4nder to the\nstatistical offices. The data have to be submitted to the\nfiscal authorities not later than ten days after the end of\nthe period covered by the advance returns. Permanent\nextensions of the deadline - meaning that the data can be\ntransmitted one month later, that is, by around 40 days\nafter the end of the period covered by the advance returns -\nare possible and are made use of by enterprises.\nWhether enterprises have to submit their advance turnover\ntax returns on a monthly or quarterly basis depends on the\namount of turnover tax they had to pay in the previous\nfiscal year. In an enterprise's start-up year and in the\nsubsequent year, the period covered by advance returns\ngenerally is one month. After that, enterprises whose\nturnover tax did not exceed 6,136 euros in the previous year\ncan submit their advance return on a quarterly basis. If an\nenterprise's tax liability is higher, it has to submit\nmonthly advance turnover tax returns.\nThe turnover of some enterprises is not contained in the\ndata of the fiscal authorities. Turnover data not contained\nare those of small enterprises (enterprises with a turnover\nof up to 17,500 euros in the previous year and an expected\nturnover of not more than 50,000 euros in the reference\nyear) and of enterprises which realise almost only tax\nexempt turnover or for which no tax payable arises. The\nlatter applies only where enterprises do not renounce the\noption of tax exemption.\nOther turnover data not included are those of annual\nrespondents, that is, of taxpayers who had to pay less than\n1,000 euros of turnover tax in the previous year and who,\nupon request, were exempted from the obligation to submit\nadvance turnover tax returns.\nThere is a major difference between current data and\nturnover data collected up to reference year 2007 due to\nturnover tax groups. Such turnover tax groups are groups of\nlegally independent enterprises which are treated as one\ndebtor in terms of tax law. Regarding a turnover tax group,\nthe data material of the fiscal authorities covers only the\ncontrolling unit, showing the turnover of the entire group.\nNo turnover data are available on the other integrated units\nbelonging to such a group. The turnover shown for the\ncontrolling unit comprises the consolidated individual\nturnovers of all members of the turnover tax group\n(controlling unit and integrated units). Although these\nconsolidated turnovers include external turnovers, they do\nnot comprise internal turnovers realised between group\nmembers.\nThe way in which the turnover of a turnover tax group is\nincluded is highly important for the evaluation of the\nadministrative data. If the turnovers of the turnover tax\ngroups - as transmitted by the fiscal authorities - were\nevaluated, the entire turnovers of any group would be shown\nfor the trade branches and regions to which the controlling\nunit is allocated. It may also happen that the controlling\nunit is not a craft enterprise and that only the relevant\nintegrated units perform craft activities. In this case, the\ngroup turnover would be shown outside the crafts sector.\nThis illustrates that serious biases may occur in the\nresults if the turnover of the individual group members is\nnot estimated. To avoid such biases, the statistical offices\nhave developed a method to estimate the turnover of all\nturnover tax group members, including an estimation of the\nlacking internal turnovers of the group.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Turnover", "type": "variable"}
