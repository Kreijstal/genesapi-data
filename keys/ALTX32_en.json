The data refer to the reporting date.\nThe year-of-age method is used to estimate the age of the\nrespondents whose birthday falls within the month of the\nmicrocensus survey. The microcensus does not cover the date\nof birth (only month of birth and year of birth). In the\nyear-of-age method, a frequency distribution of all\nbirthdays falling within the relevant survey month is used\nto estimate the birthdays lying before or after a specific\nreference day in that month. Accordingly, the relevant\npersons have, or have not, completed the higher year of age\nand are allocated to the higher age group or remain in the\ncurrent age group.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Age groups (under 20 - 75 years and over)", "type": "variable"}
