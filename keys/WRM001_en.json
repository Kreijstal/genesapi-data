It comprises the enthalpy of the flow line less the\nenthalpies of the return flow and the additional water.\nEnergy supplied via district heating circulation pumps\n(operating energy) is indirectly taken into account.\n\n\n43411 Survey of heat production and use\n=================================\n\nDefinition:\nNet production of heat is the amount of heat supplied by a\nheating plant (measured ex-works). Losses and own\nconsumption relating to heat production are not included in\nthe net production of heat.\n\n\n43421 Geothermia survey\n=================\n\nDefinition:\nHeat supplied by a heat generation installation to a network\n(measured ex-works). It comprises the enthalpy of the flow\nline less the enthalpies of the return flow and the\nadditional water.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "Net production of heat", "type": "variable"}
