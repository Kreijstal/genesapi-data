The number of hours worked in the local kind-of-\nactivity units is estimated; the average number of hours\nworked per person employed - which is collected on an\nempirical basis from establishment data - is multiplied by\nthe number of persons employed in the local kind-of-activity\nunits. This provides the estimates of the number of hours\nworked in the local kind-of-activity units.\nThe productivity ratios are calculated every year for\ntwo-digit items and aggregates of the classification of\neconomic activities. For every period and every level of\naggregation, the components of the labour input required are\nrelated to the output, represented by the production index.\nFor the hours-related productivities, the unadjusted values\nof the production index are used to calculate ratios. The\nnumbers of persons employed refer to reference dates; this\nis why the working day adjusted production indices are used\nto calculate these productivity indices.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "Index of labour productivity", "type": "variable"}
