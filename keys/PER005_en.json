The number of\nworking proprietors is estimated on the basis of the\nenterprise's legal status. Employees hired out for work and\nfor remuneration by other businesses in accordance with the\nAct on Temporary Employment Businesses are not counted as\npersons employed in craft enterprises.\nIn the census of crafts, data provided by the Federal\nEmployment Agency on employees subject to social insurance\ncontributions and marginally paid employees are evaluated.\nIt should be noted that the evaluation refers to persons\nemployed rather than employment cases, that is, employees\nwith several jobs are allocated to one establishment rather\nthan to several establishments.\nIn official statistics, persons employed include unpaid\nfamily workers. However, this group of persons cannot be\nincluded in the census of crafts because no relevant\ninformation is available in the business register or in any\nother data source available. Also, no data are currently\navailable that would permit the number of family workers to\nbe estimated.\nFor the interpretation of the variables \"employees subject\nto social insurance contributions\", \"marginally employed\npersons\" and \"persons employed\", it should also be noted\nthat all employees subject to social insurance contributions\nand marginally employed persons working in the enterprise\nare covered, that is, including those not working in the\ncraft sector (e.g. sales and/or administrative staff).\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Persons employed", "type": "variable"}
