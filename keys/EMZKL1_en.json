It is calculated from the results of\nthe official land appraisal and is one of the bases for\ndetermining assessed values and hence for the taxation of\nagricultural and forestry property. For reasons of\nsimplification and because of unclear ownership structures,\nthe fiscal authorities in the new L\u00e4nder to some extent\ndetermine the assessed values using average municipal yield\nindices.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "Yield index classes", "type": "variable"}
