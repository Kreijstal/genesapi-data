The range indicates for how many months an\nestablishment would theoretically be able to, or would have\nto, produce goods - with turnover remaining constant,\nwithout any new orders being received and without\ncancellations - to complete all orders on hand. To eliminate\nthe influence of infra-annual fluctuations in turnover on\nthe range, a moving 12-month average of the turnover total\nin the branch is used as a turnover figure.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Ranges of stocks of orders", "type": "variable"}
