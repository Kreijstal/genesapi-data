Changes of residence within a municipality are not\ncovered.\nGuests in accommodation units and the like and people\nvisiting relatives or friends are covered only if they stay\nin the municipality for a longer period of time in\naccordance with the registration regulations of the relevant\nLand and if they are actually registered with the\nregistration authority.\nSoldiers performing compulsory military service or reserve\nduty training and persons performing alternative service are\nnot covered because they are not obliged to register.\nOther persons not covered are part of the people living in\ninstitutions (for example, patients in hospitals, etc.),\nmembers of consular staff and of foreign armed forces\nstationed in the Federal Republic of Germany, sailors and\ninland waterways boatmen, professional soldiers and\nfixed-term military personnel in case of temporary absence\nfrom their base and similar special cases.\nAny person transferring their sole or main residence from a\nmunicipality located in the territory of the Federal\nRepublic of Germany to another are counted as arrivals in\nthe new municipality and as departures in the previous\nmunicipality (internal migration). Notwithstanding this\nprovision, persons moving to a foreign country are counted\nonly if they abandon their residence in the territory of the\nFederal Republic; in this case, they are counted only as\ndepartures. Migration across the borders of the Federal\nRepublic of Germany is referred to as federal external\nmigration.\nForeigners deregistering from their sole or main residence\nwithout indicating a new residence are counted only as\ndepartures and, consequently, are included under federal\nexternal migration.\n\nChanges over time:\nUntil and including 1964, federal external migration also\nincluded migration between Berlin (West) and the rest of the\nterritory of the Federal Republic.\nUntil 1983, deregistration from a second residence was\nconsidered as a departure. Persons deregistering from a\nsecond residence without indicating a new residence were\nalso considered as departures and, consequently, as arrivals\nin the municipality in which their main residence was\nlocated.\n\nRelations between concepts:\nThe difference between the number of departures and the\nnumber of arrivals (migration statistics) is the net\nmigration of any municipality.\nAs regards internal migration, the number of arrivals\nrecorded in the Land of destination is not exactly identical\nwith the number of departures recorded in the Land of\ndeparture. The balance of these differences - part of which\nare due to technical reasons, part are due to differences in\ndefinitions in the registration acts of the L\u00e4nder - is\nshown as the internal migration difference.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016\n\n\n\n", "name": "Departures to foreign countries", "type": "variable"}
