Equivalence weighting is based\non a weighting scale defining the needs weight to be\nattributed to each household member. In line with European\nstandards, the modified scale of the Organisation for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is used here.\nBased on this scale, the first adult in the household\n(person contributing most to household net income) is given\nthe weight 1.0, each other adult and each young person aged\n14 years or over gets the weight 0.5, and each child aged\nunder 14 gets the weight 0.3. Different overall weights are\nthus obtained for different household compositions. Dividing\nthe household net income by the overall weight of the\nhousehold produces the equivalised net income applying to\nall household members. The income reference year is the year\npreceding the survey.\n\nThe median of a quantitative variable falls at the exact\nmidpoint in a series of values arranged in ascending order.\nAs the median is less sensitive to outliers in the data than\nis the average (arithmetic mean) of the values, it is used\nin calculating the risk of poverty.\nIn accordance with EU convention, the threshold of the risk\nof poverty in the population is defined as 60% of the median\nof the equivalised net income of the population (in short:\n60% median).\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "Equiv. net income (median) of persons aged 16+", "type": "variable"}
