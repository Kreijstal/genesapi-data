The precondition is that the\nestablishment is affected by an unavoidable, temporary\nshortage of work due to economic reasons or because of an\ninevitable event. The work shortage must lead to a reduction\nof more than 10 percent in the gross remuneration of at\nleast a third of the establishment's employees in the\nrelevant calendar month. Granting short-time working benefit\nto employees as a partial wage replacement serves to retain\nexperienced staff in the establishment, to stabilise jobs\nand to prevent unemployment.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2017", "name": "Establishments on short-time work", "type": "variable"}
