Therefore the non-personal\ntax capacity is determined as part of the comparison of\nnon-personal taxes by applying fictitious assessment rates\nto the relevant basic amounts of the real property tax and\nthe trade tax. These fictitious rates are 180% for category\nA real property tax, 210% for category B real property tax,\nand 250% for trade tax. The fictitious assessment rates have\nremained unchanged since 1970. The fiscal capacity figures\nobtained by means of the assessment rates can therefore be\ncompared over a relatively long period. In this context it\nis accepted that, over the years, the fictitious result\n(non-personal tax capacity) will more and more fall below\nthe actual revenue of non-personal taxes, which is due to\nthe trend of increasing assessment rates.\nWhile the economic power of the municipalities is reflected\nby their non-personal tax capacity, the financial power of\nthe municipalities is shown by their fiscal capacity, the\nlatter having been increased by the revenue from the\nmunicipalities' share of income tax and turnover tax and\nreduced by the trade tax apportionment share paid.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2015", "name": "Municipal fiscal capacity", "type": "variable"}
