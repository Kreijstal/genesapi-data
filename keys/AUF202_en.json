To\ncalculate the index excluding major orders, major orders are\nsubtracted from the values of new orders in the reference\nmonth. This total of values is related to the relevant\nmonthly average excluding major orders in the base year. To\ncalculate the volume index, the data are deflated using the\nproducer price indices or the export price indices. These\nvolume indices are used to measure the price-adjusted\ndevelopment of demand.\nThese indices are aggregated to form indices for\n\"manufacturing\" and for its main industrial groupings. This\nis done by means of the proportions of the values of new\norders excluding major orders in the base year.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "New orders excluding major orders: Volume index", "type": "variable"}
