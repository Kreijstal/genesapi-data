The data also refer to the\nnaturalisation of foreigners in accordance with Section 85\nand Section 86 (1), (2) of the Foreigners Act and to those\nin accordance with Sections 8 and 9 of the Nationality Act.\n\nAs from reference year 2000, new legal bases have applied to\nnaturalisations, which is due to a reform of citizenship\nlaw. A major change is that, from that time onwards, is has\nno longer been necessary to naturalise German repatriates\nbecause this group of persons are at once considered as\nGermans as defined in Article 116 of the Basic Law, so that\nthe formal act of issuing a certificate of naturalisation is\nnot required. This means that naturalisation statistics now\nshow only naturalisations of foreigners. Other changes refer\nto the requirements of naturalisation, which have changed\ndue to the new legal bases.\n\n\n\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2016", "name": "Naturalisation of foreigners", "type": "variable"}
